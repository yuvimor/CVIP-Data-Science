# Introduction
This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed ny me during the Data Science Internship at CodersCave in October 2023. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and data-driven insights.

# Projects
## 1. Terrorism Data Exploration and Analysis
An in-depth exploration and analysis of global terrorism data, including trends, hotspots, and insights to understand the patterns and causes of terrorism.

## 2. Breast Cancer Prediction
This project aims to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features.

## 3. Email Spam Detection
This project focuses on developing a robust email spam detection system using machine learning techniques by analyzing the content and characteristics of emails.

## 4. Speech Emotion Recognition
This project aims to develop a robust speech emotion recognition system capableof accurately classifying the emotional states conveyed in spoken language such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more by analyzing the acoustic features of speech signals.
